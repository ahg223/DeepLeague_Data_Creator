# YAD2K: Yet Another Darknet 2 Keras
DeepLeague is built upon my fork of YAD2K, which is an implementation of the popular YOLO architecture in Python/Keras. Originally, I forked the YAD2K repo and included it here as a submodule, but things were getting very dirty. Instead, I forked the YAD2K repo, made a bunch of changes to it to fit my needs, and put the files directly in this repo. But, I want it to be clear that all the code related to the core architecture is not mine, all the credit goes to the YAD2K team and the creator of YOLO.
